##  Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.
#
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
## Running the project
<br/>

# `Take Note`
> ### - When your running your app on machine the server address or the host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. But if connected to any network be sure to use internet address then run the server on a different machine but connected on the same network.
>### - Always start by running the server first then the client.
- The client
```
     java -cp ./bin HotelClient
```

- Starting the server 
```
    java -cp ./bin HotelServer
```
> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
